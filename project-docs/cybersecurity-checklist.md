# ðŸ›¡ Cybersecurity Checklist for School Management System

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Enable Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)** for all database tables.
- [ ] Use **JWT-based authentication** with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens.
- [ ] Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for admin accounts.
- [ ] Enforce **strong password policy** (min length, complexity, expiry).
- [ ] Restrict sub-admin access with **time-bound temporary permissions**.
- [ ] Validate **RBAC** at both API and UI levels.

## 2. API Security
- [ ] Require **HTTPS/TLS 1.2+** for all communications.
- [ ] Validate all incoming data to prevent **SQL Injection & XSS**.
- [ ] Use **rate limiting** (middleware or Redis) to prevent brute-force attacks.
- [ ] Implement **input sanitization** for user-submitted data.
- [ ] Add **HMAC signatures** or secret tokens for webhooks.

## 3. Database Security
- [ ] Enable **RLS policies** for data access control.
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive fields (PII, financial data) at rest.
- [ ] Configure **read/write role separation** where possible.
- [ ] Keep daily automated **database backups** (Supabase supports this).
- [ ] Monitor suspicious queries and failed login attempts.

## 4. Redis (Upstash) Security
- [ ] Use **private network access** for Redis.
- [ ] Store secrets in **environment variables**, not in code.
- [ ] Limit data retention for cached content (set expiry).
- [ ] Avoid storing sensitive data (like passwords) in Redis.

## 5. Frontend Security (Next.js + React Native)
- [ ] Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers in Next.js.
- [ ] Escape all dynamic content to prevent **XSS**.
- [ ] Disable `eval()` and unsafe inline scripts.
- [ ] Use **HTTPS-only cookies** with `SameSite=Strict`.
- [ ] Remove sensitive error messages from production builds.

## 6. File Storage Security
- [ ] Store uploaded files in **Supabase Storage with signed URLs**.
- [ ] Restrict file types and size to prevent malicious uploads.
- [ ] Virus scan uploaded files (using serverless function or 3rd-party API).

## 7. Mobile App Security
- [ ] Secure **API keys** in environment variables (use Expo's secure store).
- [ ] Enable **code obfuscation** in production builds.
- [ ] Use **SSL pinning** to prevent MITM attacks.
- [ ] Enforce **secure session handling**.

## 8. Deployment & Environment
- [ ] Store all secrets in `.env` files and never commit them to Git.
- [ ] Use **Vercel environment variables** for Next.js secrets.
- [ ] Rotate keys and tokens regularly.
- [ ] Enable **auto-deploy from a secure Git branch only**.

## 9. Monitoring & Alerts
- [ ] Set up **Supabase logs monitoring** for suspicious activities.
- [ ] Use **Upstash metrics** to monitor unusual Redis activity.
- [ ] Configure error tracking with **Sentry** or similar.
- [ ] Enable **real-time alerting** for failed logins, high API errors, and data changes.

## 10. Compliance & Privacy
- [ ] Comply with **GDPR** for data handling.
- [ ] Implement a **data deletion policy** for inactive accounts.
- [ ] Maintain an **audit log** of all admin and sub-admin actions.
- [ ] Provide **consent management** for students/parents.

âœ… **Pro Tip:** Schedule **quarterly security audits** and perform **penetration testing** before major releases.
