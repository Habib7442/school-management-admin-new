# Supabase Security Fixes Applied

## Summary
Successfully fixed multiple security issues in the Supabase database and authentication configuration.

## Database Function Security Fixes ✅

Fixed "Function Search Path Mutable" security warnings by setting `search_path = public` for all affected functions:

### Functions Fixed:
1. ✅ `is_admin_or_sub_admin_cached()` - SET search_path = public
2. ✅ `get_user_role_cached()` - SET search_path = public  
3. ✅ `get_user_school_id_cached()` - SET search_path = public
4. ✅ `ensure_single_current_academic_year()` - SET search_path = public
5. ✅ `handle_updated_at()` - SET search_path = public
6. ✅ `handle_new_user()` - SET search_path = public
7. ✅ `is_admin()` - SET search_path = public
8. ✅ `is_teacher_or_admin()` - SET search_path = public
9. ✅ `generate_school_code()` - SET search_path = public
10. ✅ `update_schools_updated_at()` - SET search_path = public
11. ✅ `update_updated_at_column()` - SET search_path = public
12. ✅ `get_user_role()` - SET search_path = public
13. ✅ `get_user_school_id()` - SET search_path = public
14. ✅ `is_admin_or_sub_admin()` - SET search_path = public

**Security Impact**: Prevents SQL injection attacks by ensuring functions use a fixed search path instead of allowing role-mutable search paths.

## Authentication Security Improvements ✅

### Password Security Enhanced:
- ✅ **Minimum Password Length**: Increased from 6 to 12 characters
- ✅ **Character Requirements**: Now requires:
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z) 
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};'\\:"|<>?,./`~)

### Additional Security Features:
- ✅ **Reauthentication Required**: Password updates now require reauthentication
- ✅ **Secure Email Changes**: Already enabled
- ✅ **Refresh Token Rotation**: Already enabled
- ✅ **TOTP MFA**: Already enabled

## Issues Requiring Paid Plan ⚠️

The following security improvements require upgrading to a Pro plan or higher:

### Leaked Password Protection:
- ❌ **HaveIBeenPwned Integration**: Requires Pro plan
- **Impact**: Would prevent users from using compromised passwords

### Additional MFA Options:
- ❌ **WebAuthn/FIDO2**: Requires paid plan
- ❌ **Phone/SMS MFA**: Requires paid plan
- **Impact**: Currently only TOTP MFA is available

## Verification

All database function fixes have been verified:
- Functions now have `proconfig: ["search_path=public"]` set
- Security warnings should be resolved in next Supabase security scan

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Consider upgrading to Pro plan** for:
   - Leaked password protection
   - Additional MFA options (WebAuthn, SMS)
   - Enhanced security monitoring

2. **Current security posture is significantly improved** with:
   - Strong password requirements
   - Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Proper function security configuration

3. **Monitor security regularly** using Supabase's built-in security scanner

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

All security issues that can be fixed on the free tier have been resolved.
