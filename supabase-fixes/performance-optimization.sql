-- =============================================
-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE
-- =============================================
-- 
-- Changes made:
-- 1. Replaced function calls with subqueries: (SELECT auth.uid()) instead of auth.uid()
-- 2. Consolidated multiple permissive policies into single policies where possible
-- 3. Used explicit subqueries for role and school checks
-- 4. Reduced the number of policies from 17 to 14
-- 5. Eliminated redundant policy evaluations
--
-- Expected performance improvements:
-- - Faster query execution due to optimized RLS evaluation
-- - Reduced CPU usage from fewer policy checks
-- - Better scalability with large datasets
-- - Improved response times for library operations
